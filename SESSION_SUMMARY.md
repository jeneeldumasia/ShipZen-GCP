# ShipZen — Session Summary & Checkpoint

> **ATTENTION FOR NEXT SESSION:** Read this entire document and the `implementation_plan.md` artifact before writing any code or making architectural changes.

## Project Context
- **Owner:** Jeneel (student)
- **Domain:** `jeneeldumasia.codes` — platform served at `shipzen.jeneeldumasia.codes`
- **DNS pattern:** `{dep-id}.{project}.shipzen.jeneeldumasia.codes` per deployment
- **AWS Credits:** ~$134 remaining. Infra torn down after every session.
- **Node type:** `m7i-flex.large` (EKS 1.36, AL2023). t3.medium caused lag.
- **Cost:** ~$0.40–0.50/hr base when cluster is live.
- **Repo:** `github.com/jeneeldumasia/ShipZen`
- **State backend:** HCP Terraform (`jeneel-shipzen` org, `shipzen-prod` workspace)

## Architectural Decisions This Session (June 19)

We finalized the **3-Tier Ephemeral Builder** architecture to support zero-config "deploy anything" without introducing a permanent, shared blast radius.

1. **Tier 1 (Buildpacks):** The default fallback. Runs `pack` rootless in `shipzen-builder`.
2. **Tier 2 (Dockerfile):** If `Dockerfile` exists, run BuildKit in `shipzen-builder-privileged`.
3. **Tier 3 (Railpack):** If complex/mixed repo (e.g., `Cargo.toml`, `bun.lockb`), run Railpack natively in `shipzen-builder-privileged`.

**Key Operational Agreements:**
- **No Shared BuildKit Farm:** Every build is a single-use Kubernetes `Job` that instantly terminates.
- **Detector Framework:** Routing is deterministic via `DockerfileDetector`, `RailpackDetector`, etc., not probabilistic.
- **Telemetry:** Schema will be updated to track `builder_type`, `build_duration_sec`, and cache ratios.
- **Caching:** We will use ECR Lifecycle rules to prune `cache-buildpacks` and `cache-railpack` registries.
- **Security:** Privileged Jobs are strictly constrained by NodePool caps (max 5 nodes), 15-minute active deadline timeouts, and 2vCPU/4Gi limits.

## What Has Been Built

### Backend Services
- **API** (`api/`) — FastAPI, 10 endpoints. User inputs repo URL only; platform auto-generates image URI.
- **Worker** (`worker/`) — Redis Streams consumer, state machine (Queued→Building→Deploying→Verifying→Running→Failed/DLQ), retry with exponential backoff. *(Note: pending major refactor to spawn K8s Jobs instead of pushing to builder queue).*
- **Controller** (`controller/`) — Reconciliation loop, K8s namespace provisioning via Python client, drift detection.
- **Builder** (`builder/`) — *(Note: transitioning from KEDA-scaled Redis consumer to single-use K8s Jobs).*
- **Schema** (`api/schema.sql`) — PostgreSQL. Tables: `projects`, `deployments`, `builds`, `audit_logs`.

### Infrastructure
- **Terraform** provisions: VPC, EKS 1.36, EBS CSI addon (IRSA), ECR, S3 (build logs, encrypted), Karpenter, KEDA, ESO, cert-manager, ALB Controller, kube-prometheus-stack, ArgoCD, Redis (Bitnami), PostgreSQL (Bitnami).
- **ArgoCD** syncs `infra/` — controller, worker, API, builder, scale, secrets, schema Job.
- **Karpenter** — builder NodePool (tainted `shipzen.io/dedicated=builder`) + tenant NodePool (tainted `shipzen.io/dedicated=tenant`).
- **Gateway** — Envoy Gateway, wildcard TLS on `*.shipzen.jeneeldumasia.codes`, HTTP→HTTPS redirect.

### UI (`ui/`)
- Next.js 14 App Router, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, `lucide-react`.
- Pages: Dashboard, Projects, New Project, Project Detail, Deploy Form, Deployment Detail (with visual pipeline tracker).

## Known Issues & Warnings

**Still outstanding (see `docs/TASKS.md` for full backlog):**
| ID | Priority | Issue |
|----|----------|-------|
| OBS-1 | P1 | Per-pod monitoring not wired up (PodMonitor per tenant namespace) |
| OBS-2 | P1 | Grafana dashboards reference non-existent metrics — need rewriting |
| OBS-3 | P1 | Missing `shipzen_deployment_success_total`, `_failure_total`, `build_duration_seconds` metrics |
| FEAT-3 | P2 | GitHub Webhook → auto-deploy not implemented |

## Next Session: Execution Phase

We will execute the `task.md` created this session:
1. **BuildKit PoC:** Validate required `securityContext` to run `moby/buildkit` rootless/privileged inside EKS.
2. **Schema Upgrades:** Add new build telemetry fields.
3. **Worker Refactor:** Implement the `Builder` detector framework and rip out the Redis `builder_queue`.
4. **Job Orchestration:** Generate dynamic restricted/privileged K8s Job manifests and stream logs back to Redis/S3.
5. **Terraform/Infra:** Configure the `shipzen-builder-privileged` namespace, ECR Lifecycle policies, and NodePool taints.

*Last updated: 2026-06-19. Finalized 3-Tier Ephemeral Builder architecture.*

## Architectural Decisions This Session (June 23)
- Fixed Karpenter EKS Pod Identity Webhook bug by hardcoding AWS_ROLE_ARN and projected volume tokens.
- Addressed AWS Secrets Manager sync issues (fixed typos and created dummy secrets to unblock API startup).
- Resolved ArgoCD delay issues by patching 	imeout.reconciliation to 10 seconds.
- Identified Cloudflare Edge-to-Origin SSL mismatch: API subdomain was not covered by the Terraform-provisioned Origin CA cert. 
- Implemented **Path-Based Routing** for the API (/api/v1/* -> shipzen-api) to reuse the UI's valid Cloudflare Edge SSL certificate.
- Identified the Build failure: shipzen-worker requires the same Pod Identity hardcoding as Karpenter to authorize S3 PutObject for build logs.

## Next Session (June 23 Continued)
1. **Worker Pod Identity**: Patch infra/worker/deployment.yaml with explicit projected volume and AWS_ROLE_ARN for shipzen-worker so it can upload logs to S3.
2. Verify Kaniko builds succeed and stream logs correctly.
- Upgraded the Auto-Destroy Deadman Switch (.github/workflows/auto-destroy.yaml) to run hourly, enforcing a 6-hour max cluster uptime limit. Added failsafe logic to detect lingering VPCs (partial destroy state) even if the EKS cluster is gone, to prevent leaked resources (like NAT Gateways) from consuming credits.

## Lessons Learned (June 24)
- **Troubleshooting Priority:** When debugging Kubernetes deployment or job failures, **ALWAYS check the cluster events first** (`kubectl get events`, `kubectl describe pod/job`) before diving into application code or IAM permissions. Do not get tunnel vision on symptoms (like UI WebSockets timing out or logs failing to load) without first verifying the root cause of the failure at the infrastructure/control plane level. In this case, missing the fact that the `shipzen-build` namespace didn't exist/was blocked by Kyverno led to hours of wasted debugging on secondary issues.

## Architectural Decisions This Session (July 18)
- **Production Readiness Fixes**:
  - Removed local dev auth stubs in favor of a strict `ENABLE_LOCAL_STUB_AUTH=true` environment variable.
  - Replaced hardcoded database admin emails with `ADMIN_EMAILS` environment variable.
  - Hardened database connection logic with explicit transaction boundaries (`conn.commit()`) to solve user creation race conditions.
  - Updated API proxy parsing to respect `X-Forwarded-For` from Envoy Gateway, mitigating rate limit exhaustion.
  - Enforced CORS restrictions against `localhost:3000` in production.
  - Deleted `alert-secret.json` to fully rely on ESO (External Secrets Operator).
