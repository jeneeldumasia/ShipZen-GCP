# Production Readiness Review (PRR) Scorecard

## 1. Architecture & Design
- **Source of Truth:** PostgreSQL is fully implemented and acts as the strict source of truth for all Deployments, Projects, and Builds.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Redis Streams deployed for idempotent queueing. The Python Worker completely decouples API requests from the build pool.
- **Reconciliation Loop:** The Python Controller continuously resolves drift at the tenant and deployment levels.

## 2. Security & Compliance
- **Tenant Isolation:** NetworkPolicies (IMDS Blocked, internal CIDRs blocked), Restricted PSS, and dedicated Namespaces enforced.
- **Secrets Management:** GCP Secret Manager + External Secrets Operator completely abstract secrets from the cluster environment.
- **Audit Logging:** The `audit_logs` table strictly tracks mutations in an append-only architecture.

## 3. Scale & Reliability
- **Autoscaling:** Cluster Autoscaler NodePools established with Spot/On-Demand fallbacks.
- **High Availability:** Pod Disruption Budgets (minAvailable: 1) and HorizontalPodAutoscalers configured for the Control Plane.

## 4. Observability
- **SLOs Defined:** 4 core aggregate metrics built into Prometheus rules.
- **Alerts:** 7 critical alerts (Backlog, DLQ, Builder Failures, Drift) implemented.
- **Dashboards:** ConfigMaps created for 4 operational Grafana dashboards.

**Final Score:** 100% Ready for Staging/Production Deployment.

*(Update July 18)*: Additional security audits resulted in strict environment variable gates for local authentication stubs (`ENABLE_LOCAL_STUB_AUTH`), parameterized `ADMIN_EMAILS`, and proxy-aware rate limit hardening (`X-Forwarded-For`), closing all remaining deployment blockers.
